# SDL_Test_Bed
A quick and dirty SDL2 base project.  For testing/creation of components of larger applications/games.

A very basic SDL2 project.  Contains a very basic input handler and frame timing method but can be easily modified to
use more advanced methods.

Instead of cloning, I usually just copy the files as they are into a new project for creation, testing, and develop of
components of a game or app.


Others' are free to use this, but you'll have likely have to chage the include directories to match your system.
